"This is the quantity of products from an inventory point of view. For moves "
"in the state 'done', this is the quantity of products that were actually "
"moved. For other moves, this is the quantity of product that is planned to "
"be moved. Lowering this quantity does not generate a backorder. Changing "
"this quantity on assigned moves affects the product reservation, and should "
"be done with care."
